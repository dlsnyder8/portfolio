I worked proactively to ensure that the company was profitable and to find and apply for alternative funding sources as needed to host 'Alcohol Initiative Nights', which were events that were meant to provide a safe space for students to socialize without alcohol. In the fall of 2020, I took over as the de-facto Technology Chair for the organization and was responsible for updating our website with new promotional materials, information about our events, and menu updates. I also worked with a group on campus to develop an online ordering system in my final semester at Princeton."
